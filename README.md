# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

This web application is a random password generator. Based off user input, it generates a custom password that contains randomized characters.

This project helped me work with javascript for the first time and create something based on user input. Throughout this project, I was able to define variables, create functions, use if statements and for loops, all in order to generate a custom password based on user input.

## Instalation

This entire project was made in Visual Studio. We were provided starting code from the UCSD Extended Studies Coding Bootcamp, which I inserted into a github repository and then made changes to. 

## Usage

The final product looks like this:

If you click the red Generate Password button, your custom password will be generated after your user input is provided.

This application was built with assistance from my peers and instructors within the UCSD Extended Studies Coding Bootcamp.
